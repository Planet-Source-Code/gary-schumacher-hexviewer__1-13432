### Description

Display the contents of any file in Hex/Ascii format. Code is well-documented and demonstrates uses of the Status Bar, Progress Bar & Rich Text Box controls.

Updated program on 12/13/2000: Added a C Dll that greatly increased format speed of input file.

Check HexView.cpp for a tip on how to debug a dll called from Visual Basic.

I included Visual Basic statements in the HexView.cpp file so it serves as a tutorial for someone interested in writing a C Dll.
